## Getting ready

You need to install AntConc and download a data file to follow this lesson.

### Installing and running AntConc

You can download AntConc from [https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/](https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/). This lesson has been developed and tested with AntConc version 3.5.8.

If you are using an older version, it is recommended you upgrade to the latest tested version. 

There are versions for Windows, macOS and Linux.

Please follow the installation instructions on the main [AntConc page](https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/).

### Downloading the data

You can download [BM-MDG.zip](https://github.com/CatalogueLegacies/antconc.github.io/blob/gh-pages/data/BM-MDG.zip), which is a .zip file that contains a corpus seperated into twelve .txt files. Clicking on [BM-MDG.zip](https://github.com/CatalogueLegacies/antconc.github.io/blob/gh-pages/data/BM-MDG.zip) will open the file in a new browser tab. Be sure to right click or control click in order to save the file (NOTE: In Safari, right click and select **download linked file**; in Chrome and Firefox, right click and select **save link as...**). Unzip the contents and make a note of the location (i.e. the folder, your desktop) in which the twelve .txt files are saved.

If you want to know more about the dataset, see Baker, James, & Salway, Andrew. (2019, June 13). Creation of the BMSatire Descriptions corpus (Version v1.0). Zenodo. [http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3245037](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3245037).
