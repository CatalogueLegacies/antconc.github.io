# This file documents the decisions made the resulted in the creation of IAMS_Photographs_1850-1950_selection3.txt

1. The British Library prepared `IAMS_Photographs_1850_1950_NO_EAP_PUBLISHED.csv`, a file containing 157,910 records for photographs in [IAMS](http://searcharchives.bl.uk/) where the catalogue data was licenced [Creative Commons Zero](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/).
2. The 'ScopeContent' field (containing ~4m words) was selected for analysis as is contained free-text descriptions of the collection.
3. We appraised the dataset and decided to: remove lists (e.g. `Subjects = Ramsden Collection; river scenes; waterfalls Location = Gersoppa Falls; India; Karnataka; Sharavati (river)`); remove subject headings (e.g. `Genre: Landscape Photography`); keep quoted text due to variability of cues to quoted text and hence the difficulty of removing quoted text computationally (this is in contrast to our previous work on the *British Museum Catalogue of Satires* were cues to quoted text were consistent and therefore more easy to remove computationally; see Baker, James, & Salway, Andrew. (2019, June 13). Creation of the BMSatire Descriptions corpus (Version v1.0). Zenodo. [http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3245037](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3245037).
4. Python script written with regex pattern `^\"*Genre.?\.(.?)(Subject|Location)`, where text inside the first set of brackets is kept. This produced 759,930 words organised into 45,546 fragments (each from a distinct description) shorn of Genre, Subject and Location lists.
