This Carpentries-style lesson introduces people working in catalogue-related roles in galleries, libraries, archives, and museums to analysing catalogue data in AntConc. At the conclusion of the lesson you will understand what the AntConc software does and how to use approaches from computational linguistics for the purposes of examining catalogue data.

> ## Prerequisites
