## Introducing Collocates

The collocates of a word are those words that tend to occur in proximity to that word more than they occur in proximity to all other words in the corpus. The idea of collocation is implemented using a variety of different statistics to determine the co-occurrence of words.

Click on the `Collocates` tab, enter the string "behind" in the search box, ensure that `Words` is ticked and `Case` is unticked, change `Sort by` to `Sort by Freq`, then press `Start`. After a little time an error will pop up.

> ## AntConc tab interdependencies
>
>* Outputs in the `Collocates` tab are based on data generated by the `Word List` tab, so both need to have the same `Tool Preferences` for the `Collocates` tab to work properly.
>* In this case, go to `Tool Preferences`, untick `Treat all data as lowercase`, hit `Apply`, and then hit `Start` again.
>* The moral here then is that in AntConc any search needs to be undertaken with care. For `Collocates` in particular, you need to know **exactly** what you’ve searched for in order to read the statistical output.

AntConc then presents a slightly confusing screen. It contains the following information:

* A ranking of words by frequency, specifically - using the default `Collocates` settings - those five words either side of the word "behind". The proximity to the searched for word can be changed in the bottom right of the screen, more on which shortly.
* The frequency of the word, broken down into two columns: one by frequency to the left of the word "behind", and one by frequency to the right of the word "behind".
* A `Stat` (more on which shortly).

## Reading Collocates

Browsing this we can start to make some observations, building on similar themes from episodes [five](https://cataloguelegacies.github.io/antconc.github.io/05-wordlists/index.html) and [six](https://cataloguelegacies.github.io/antconc.github.io/06-search/index.html). We see many commons words ("the", "of", "and", "a"). We see that men ("him", "Sir", "his", "man") and actions ("standing", "seated") are related to this spatial term. And we see a long tail of vocabulary, 855 of the 1136 unique words (or about 3 in 4) occur only once in proximity to the word "behind'.

Now edit the `From..` and `To..` settings to `1L` and `1R` respectively, and hit `Start` again. A few things stand out:

* Some high frequency words have zero or very small frequencies on one or either side of "behind";
* Some words have jumped up the list ("him" from 14 to 3, "her" from 22 to 11, "hillside" from 57 to 14);
* Commons words ("the", "and", "a", "is") have `Stat` values of two or lower.

This output tells us something about both language use and the subject of the cataloguing.

* There are a lot of people (mostly men) and things (scroll down) described in relation to their relative depth.
* The high frequency of 'standing behind' compared with 'Standing behind' suggests that the relation between things doesn’t cross sentences. If we click on "standing" we go - once again - to the `Condordance` tab to see examples of this. And whilst not the small number of examples (55) is not statistically significant, this gives us a way into the style of the cataloguer(s) and reminds us of the value of retaining capitalization.
* At a more trivial level, the absence of "his behind", "your behind", and "my behind" tells us that posteriors are not described by the cataloguer.
* We can also start to make inferences about the high `stat` values for words that have jumped up the list ("his", "her", "hillside"), as well as the use of proper names and locations, though to do this properly we need to know more about what the `stat` value means. As a rule, collocation statistics should be read with caution.

## Reading stat values

>## Task 1: What might the stat value signify?
>* Note: to solve this problem, start by going to the `Collocates` tab for the string "behind" (`Words` ticked, `Case` unticked, `From..` and `To..` settings to `1L` and `1R` respectively) and observe the stat column. Note that the values around 0.5 and below (and even in negative!) are words like "a", "and", "left": words that we know are common in the corpus. Note also that the higher stat values are for those words that have jumped up the list since we moved from `5L/5R` to `1L/1R` ("them", "just", "immediately").
>
>>## Solution
>>
>>* The stat value signifies the unusually high or low occurrence of words near the target word, compared to the occurance of those words in the corpus as a whole. So, there are **fewer** occurrences of "a" `1L/1R` of "behind" than we would expect given the frequency of "a" in the corpus, and a **greater** number of occurances of "them" or "just" `1L/1R` of "behind" than we would expect given the frequency of "them" and "just" in the corpus
>>>* Note: by default, the `Stat` column records a '[Mutual Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information)' score, which is a measure of the probability that the collocate and key word occur near to each other, relative to how many times they each occur in total.

Now we have a better sense of what `Stat` is doing, change `Sort by` to `Sort by Stat` and hit `Start`. All the top 250 or so ranked works are now those that occur only once or twice `1L/1R` of "behind", and that - as a result - have high stat scores. This isn’t very useful. To work more effectively with `Sort by Stat`, change the `Min. Collocate Frequency` field to "10" and hit `Start`. We now have sensible results - "immediately", "them", and "Just" pop to the top, and by browsing the list we can continue to make inferences about both the language used in cataloguing and the subject of that cataloguing:

* Verbs in the present tense forms are prominent.
* Relative spatial arrangements ("behind her", "stand behind", "close behind") are important features of the corpus.
* There are suggestions that the cataloguing used a relatively controlled vocabulary and phrasing: for example, if we click on the word "pen" almost all of the forty-two occurances are for the phrase ‘a pen behind his ear’.
* Proper names ("Sheridan", "Pitt", "Napoleon", "Wellington") are frequent, tend to occur in proximity to spatial words like "behind", and tend to appear before the word "behind", suggesting they appear towards the front of the satirical prints described in the corpus.

## From collocation to curatorial voice 

The `Collocates` tab enables you to create a statistical overview of a corpus. But small changes to the variables in the `Collocates` tab can significantly change the statistics that are produced. The tool then needs to be used with caution.

>## Task 2: How regularised are the descriptions of clothing, accessories, and body adornments?
>* Note: to solve this problem, start by searching in the `Collocates` tab for `wear|wears|wearing|wore` (with `Words` ticked, `Case` unticked). You may need to adjust the other settings to capture the ways that words for clothing (e.g. "hat") are used in proximity to the verb "to wear". 
>
>>## Solution
>>
>>1. There is no one way of examining this problem. One approach is to edit your `From..` and `To..` settings to `4L` and `4R` respectively, chose the `Sort by Stat` option, and set the `Min. Collocate Frequency` field to "25".
>>2. Hit `Start`. Note that even at this frequency, some very specialised language is present: "biretta" (a type of hat worn by Roman Catholic clergy), "bicorne" (a military hat associated with Napoleon), and "rouges" (presumably with "bonnet" to refer to a type of French revolutionary hat). This indicates that precision was important to the cataloguer.
>>3. In terms of controlled vocabulary there is one prominent example: 100 occurances of "spectacles" in the output (48 "spectacles" and 52 "spectacles,"), compared with zero occurances of "glasses". 
>>>* Note: this suggests a use case for corpus linguistics in the review of catalogue data, because tools like those in AntConc's `concordance` tab can indicate historically specific cataloguing choices that may have implications for contemporary user experience for catalogue data.
