## Introducing Collocates

The collocates of a word are those words that tend to occur in proximity to that word more than they occur in proximity to all other words in the corpus general. The idea of collocation is implemented using a variety of different statistics to determine the co-occurrence of words.

Click on the `Collocates` tab, enter the string "behind" in the search box, ensure that `Words` is ticked and `Case` is unticked, change `Sort by` to `Sort by Freq`, then press `Start`.

> ## AntConc tab interdependencies
>
> Outputs in the `Collocates` tab are based on data generated by the `Word List` tab, so both need to have the same `Tool Preferences` for the `Collocates` tab to work properly. The moral here then is that in AntConc any search needs to be undertaken with care. For `Collocates` in particular, you need to know **exactly** what you’ve searched for in order to read the statistical output.

Antconc then presents a returns a slightly confusing screen. It contains the following information:

* A ranking of words by frequency, specifically - using the default `Collocates` settings - those words five words either side of the word "behind". The proximity to the searched for word can be changed in the bottom right of the screen, more on which shortly.
* The frequency of the word, broken down into two columns: one by frequency to the left of the word "behind", and one by frequency to the right of the word "behind".
* A `Stat` (more on which shortly).

## Reading Collocates

Browsing this we can start to make some observations, building on similar themes from episodes [five](https://cataloguelegacies.github.io/antconc.github.io/05-wordlists/index.html) and [six](https://cataloguelegacies.github.io/antconc.github.io/06-search/index.html). We see many commons words ("the", "a", "is", "and"). We see that people ("him", "his", "her") and actions ("stands", "says", "says") are related to spatial term. And we see a long tail of vocabulary, 5509 of the 24292 unique words (or about 1 in 5) occur at least once in proximity to the word "behind'.

Now edit the `From..` and `To..` settings to `1L` and `1R` respectively, and hit `Start` again. A few things stand out:

* Some high frequency words have zero or very small frequencies on one or either side of "behind";
* Some words have jumped up the list ("them" from 17 to 5, "just" from 65 to 17, "immediately" from 81 to 19);
* There is one word in the top 15 words ("a") that has a negative stat value.

This output tells us something about both language use and the subject of the cataloguing.

* The absence of "the behind", "a behind", and "this behind" tells us that bums are not described as "behinds" ([George](https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/45657) tends to prefere "posterior").
* The dominance of "behind are" over "are behind", suggests a preference for saying 'where' then 'what' in a sentence, rather than 'what' then 'where' then 'what' (that is, the relation between things doesn’t cross sentences). If we click on "are" we go - once again - to the `Condordance` tab to see examples of this: "Behind are constables with staves", "Behind are flames", "close behind are eight other judges", etc, are more common than over "The cobbler and his wife are behind a stall" or "His hands are behind him".	
	* We are also reminded of the value of retaining capitalization (look at how common it is to see punctuation before "Behind".
* We can also start to make inferences about the high `stat` values for words that have jumped up the list ("them", "just", "immediately"), though to do this properly we need to know more about what the `stat` value means.

## Reading Stat values

>## Task 1: What might the stat value signify?
>* Note: to solve this problem, start by going to the `Collocates` tab for the string "behind" (`Words` ticked, `Case` unticked, `From..` and `To..` settings to `1L` and `1R` respectively) and observe the stat column. Note that the values around 0.5 and below (and even in negative!) are words like "a", "and", "left": words that we know are common in the corpus. Note also that the higher stat values are for those words that have jumped up the list since we moved from `5L/5R` to `1L/1R` ("them", "just", "immediately"). Given this information, work in pairs to discuss what might the stat value signify?
>
>>## Solution
>>
>* The stat value signifies the unusually high or low occurrence of words near the target word, compared to the occurance of those words in the corpus as a whole. So, there are **fewer** occurrences of "a" `1L/1R` of "behind" than we would expect given the frequency of "a" in the corpus, and a **greater** number of occurances of "just" `1L/1R` of "behind" than we would expect given the frequency of "just" in the corpus
>>* Note: by default, the `Stat` column records a '[Mutual Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information)' score, which is a measure of the probability that the collocate and key word occur near to each other, relative to how many times they each occur in total.)
>{: .solution}
{: .challenge}

Now we have a better sense of what `Stat` is doing, change `Sort by` to `Sort by Stat` and hit `Start`. All the top 50 ranked works are now those that occur only once `1L/1R` of "behind", and that - as a result - have high stat scores. This isn’t very useful. To work more effectively with `Sort by Stat`, change the `Min. Collocate Frequency` field to "10" and hit `Start`. We now have sensible results - "immediately", "them", and "just" pop to the top, and we by browsing the list we can continue to make inferences about both the language used in cataloguing and the subject of that cataloguing:

* Verbs in the present tense forms are prominent.
* Relative spatial arrangements ("behind her", "stand behind", "close behind") are important features of the corpus.
* There are suggestions that the cataloguing used a relatively controlled vocabulary and phrasing: for example, if we click on the word "pen" almost all of the forty-two occurances are for the phrase ‘a pen behind his ear’.
* Proper names ("Canning", "Castlereagh", "Napoleon", "Wellington") are frequent, tend to occur in proximity to spatial words like "behind", and tend to appear before the word "behind", suggesting they they appear towards the front of the satirical prints described in the corpus.
