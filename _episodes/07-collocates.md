## Introducing Collocates

The collocates of a word are those words that tend to occur in proximity to that word more than they occur in proximity to all other words in the corpus general. The idea of collocation is implemented using a variety of different statistics to determine the co-occurrence of words.

Click on the `Collocates` tab, enter the string "behind" in the search box, ensure that `Words` is ticked and `Case` is unticked, change `Sort by` to `Sort by Freq`, then press `Start`.

> ## AntConc tab interdependencies
>
> Outputs in the `Collocates` tab are based on data generated by the `Word List` tab, so both need to have the same `Tool Preferences` for the `Collocates` tab to work properly. The moral here then is that in AntConc any search needs to be undertaken with care. For `Collocates` in particular, you need to know **exactly** what you’ve searched for in order to read the statistical output.

Antconc then presents a returns a slightly confusing screen. It contains the following information:

* A ranking of words by frequency, specifically - using the default `Collocates` settings - those words five words either side of the word "behind". The proximity to the searched for word can be changed in the bottom right of the screen, more on which shortly.
* The frequency of the word, broken down into two columns: one by frequency to the left of the word "behind", and one by frequency to the right of the word "behind".
* A `Stat` (more on which shortly).

## Reading Collocates

Browsing this we can start to make some observations, building on similar themes from episodes [five](https://cataloguelegacies.github.io/antconc.github.io/05-wordlists/index.html) and [six](https://cataloguelegacies.github.io/antconc.github.io/06-search/index.html). We see many commons words ("the", "a", "is", "and"). We see that people ("him", "his", "her") and actions ("stands", "says", "says") are related to spatial term. And we see a long tail of vocabulary, 5509 of the 24292 unique words (or about 1 in 5) occur at least once in proximity to the word "behind'.

Now edit the `From..` and `To..` settings to `1L` and `1R` respectively, and hit `Start` again. A few things stand out:

* Some high frequency words have zero or very small frequencies on one or either side of "behind";
* Some words have jumped up the list ("them" from 17 to 5, "just" from 65 to 17, "immediately" from 81 to 19);
* There is one word in the top 15 words ("a") that has a negative stat value.

This output tells us something about both language use and the subject of the cataloguing.

* The absence of "the behind", "a behind", and "this behind" tells us that bums are not described as "behinds" ([George](https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/45657) tends to prefere "posterior").
* The dominance of "behind are" over "are behind", suggests a preference for saying 'where' then 'what' in a sentence, rather than 'what' then 'where' then 'what' (that is, the relation between things doesn’t cross sentences). If we click on "are" we go - once again - to the `Condordance` tab to see examples of this: "Behind are constables with staves", "Behind are flames", "close behind are eight other judges", etc, are more common than over "The cobbler and his wife are behind a stall" or "His hands are behind him".	
	* We are also reminded of the value of retaining capitalization (look at how common it is to see punctuation before "Behind".
* We can also start to make inferences about the high `stat` values for words that have jumped up the list ("them", "just", "immediately"), though to do this properly we need to know more about what the `stat` value means.

## Reading Stat values

>## Task 1: What might the stat value signify?
>* Note: to solve this problem, start by going to the `Collocates` tab for the string "behind" (`Words` ticked, `Case` unticked, `From..` and `To..` settings to `1L` and `1R` respectively) and observe the stat column. Note that the values around 0.5 and below (and even in negative!) are words like "a", "and", "left": words that we know are common in the corpus. Note also that the higher stat values are for those words that have jumped up the list since we moved from `5L/5R` to `1L/1R` ("them", "just", "immediately"). Given this information, work in pairs to discuss what might the stat value signify?
>
>>## Solution
>>
>* The stat value signifies the unusually high or low occurrence of words near the target word, compared to the occurance of those words in the corpus as a whole. So, there are **fewer** occurrences of "a" `1L/1R` of "behind" than we would expect given the frequency of "a" in the corpus, and a **greater** number of occurances of "just" `1L/1R` of "behind" than we would expect given the frequency of "just" in the corpus
>>* Note: by default, the `Stat` column records a '[Mutual Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information)' score, which is a measure of the probability that the collocate and key word occur near to each other, relative to how many times they each occur in total.)

### Common transformations
Some transformations are used regularly and are accessible directly through menu options, without having to type them directly.

Examples of some of these common transformations are given in the table below, with their 'GREL' equivalents. We'll see how to use the GREL version later in this lesson.

Common Transformation  | Action | GREL expression
--------------------| ------------- | -------------
To Uppercase| Converts the current value to uppercase | ```value.toUppercase()```
To Lowercase| Converts the current value to lowercase | ```value.toLowercase()```
To Titlecase| Converts the current value to titlecase (i.e. each word starts with an uppercase character and all other characters are converted to lowercase) | ```value.toTitlecase()```
Trim leading and trailing whitespace | Removes any 'whitespace' characters (e.g. spaces, tabs) from the start or end of the current value | ```value.trim()```

> ## Comparative analysis in AntConc
>
> By working on multiple files, and by providing outputs that identify which result relates to which file, the `Concordance` tab gives us a way into comparative analysis of catalogue data, be that longitudinal (files seperated by the decades in which catalogue entries were made), by collection, or be catalouger. We discuss comparing corpora in more detail in a [later episode](https://cataloguelegacies.github.io/antconc.github.io/09-comparing/index.html).

>## Task 1: get to know the Kwic sort
>* Search the corpus until you find a word with somehow between 50 and 100 hits (you might want to play around with the `Words` and `Case` options to narrow or expand your search). Spending a few minutes changing the `Kwic Sort` to resort your output in various ways. Write down any queries you have about how the sort works and ask your instructor when the time is up.
{: .challenge}

>## Task 2: Work out rough % of the word "he" used at the start of a sentence.
>* Note: to solve this problem, you may find it helpful to do more than one search.
>
>>## Solution
>>
>>1. Search "he" and "He" separately with `Words` and `Case` both ticked. You should get `4716` hits for "he" and `4456` hits for "He".
>>2. The answer is just under half.
>>>* If you scroll through the results, you'll see that this is an exact solution *for this corpus*. However, this is not a perfect query, as other corpora may contain typographic errors or uncommon uses of the word "he". This is an example when knowing your corpus can help you craft a good enough query, rather than have to expend time and energy creating the perfect query. Handily, the ouputs provided by AntConc are a great way of getting to know a corpus.
