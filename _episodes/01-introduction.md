## What is AntConc?
AntConc is a freeware software programme for working language corpora using a graphical user interface. Within AntConc are a 
number of 'tools' that support linguistic analysis by enabling the user to - for example - search corpora, to generate lists of words in corpora, and to browse 'concordances' of word use in corpora. 

## What is corpus lingustics?
Corpus linguistics is the study of language through corpora, usually large collections of machine readable text. In order to study large collections, corpus linguistics - and those adopting their methods - use software tools to query their chosen corpora using computational processes. The outputs of that processing are typically a combination of counts of words (or lemma), statistical inferences about word use, comparisons with standard language corpora, and subsets of text. These outputs are then analysed by people, from which new queries are formed, and new processing and analysis is made. Corpus lingustics is therefore an iterative study of text, where a phenomena suggested by one output is tested and refined by the next
