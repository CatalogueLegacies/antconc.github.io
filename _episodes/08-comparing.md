## Why Compare

This episode introduces potential next steps for comparing corpora. Each of the three sections are only intended as jumping off points, rather than comprehensive accounts of their methods. This is because the method of comparison will be shaped your initial lingustic analysis: as we wrote in [Episode 1](https://cataloguelegacies.github.io/antconc.github.io/01-introduction/index.html), corpus lingustics is therefore an iterative study of text, where a phenomenon suggested by one output is tested and refined by the next.

In the context of catalogue data, there are a number of reasons to compare corpora: because comparison provides an alternative point of analysis for defining the features of a given catalogue data under analysis; because a given catalogue can be broken into subsets that are then analysed comparatively (e.g. taking a exemplar or baseline collection of catalogue data to better understand the linguistic features of given subset in need of attention); because comparisons of catalogue data with other types of texts - e.g. everyday speech - can helpfully tease out the "special language" that might form the basis of, say, a guide to cataloguing at your institution.

Used creatively, AntConc can provide the basic toolset required to undertake a variety of comparative analyses, though the deeper your comparing goes, the more you may find yourself needing other computatational approaches.
