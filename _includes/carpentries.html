    <p>"<a href="https://cataloguelegacies.github.io/">Legacies of Catalogue Descriptions and Curatorial Voice: Opportunities for Digital Scholarship</a>" is a project funded under the Arts and Humanities Research Council (UK) “<a href="https://ahrc.ukri.org/funding/apply-for-funding/current-opportunities/uk-us-collaboration-for-digital-scholarship-in-cultural-institutions-partnership-development-grants-opportunity/">UK-US Collaboration for Digital Scholarship in Cultural Institutions: Partnership Development Grants</a>” scheme (Project Reference <a href="https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FT013036%2F1">AH/T013036/1</a>). The project aims to develop a platform for a transformational impact in digital scholarship within cultural institutions by opening up new and important directions for computational, critical, and curatorial analysis of collection catalogues. Extensive digital and digitised sets of curatorial descriptions from legacy catalogues are increasingly available. We seek to realise their potential as valuable resources for cross-disciplinary research into curatorial practice, and for enhancing access to and analysis of collections at scale. The project is a collaboration between the <a href="hhttp://www.sussex.ac.uk/shl/">Sussex Humanities Lab</a>, the <a href="https://www.bl.uk/">British Library</a>, and <a href="https://web.library.yale.edu/">Yale University Library</a>.</p>

    <p><a href="{{ site.carpentries_site }}">The Carpentries</a> comprises
    Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and Library Carpentry communities of Instructors, Trainers,
    Maintainers, helpers, and supporters who share a mission to teach
    foundational coding and data science skills to researchers and people 
    working in library- and information-related roles. In January,
    2018, The Carpentries was formed by the merger of Software Carpentry and
    Data Carpentry. Library Carpentry became an official Carpentries Lesson Program in November 2018.</p>

    <p>While individual lessons and workshops continue to be run under each
    lesson project, The Carpentries provide overall staffing and governance, as
    well as support for assessment, instructor training and mentoring.
    Memberships are joint, and the Carpentries project maintains a shared Code
    of Conduct. The Carpentries is a fiscally sponsored project of Community
    Initiatives, a registered 501(c)3 non-profit based in California, USA.</p>

     <p>Since 1998, <a href="{{ site.swc_site }}">Software Carpentry</a> has
    been teaching researchers across all disciplines the foundational coding
    skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain. Its
    volunteer instructors have run hundreds of events for thousands of learners
    around the world. Now that all research involves some degree of
    computational work, whether with big data, cloud computing, or simple task
    automation, these skills are needed more than ever.</p>

    <p><a href="{{ site.dc_site }}">Data Carpentry</a> develops and teaches
    workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research. Its
    target audience is researchers who have little to no prior computational
    experience, and its lessons are domain specific, building on learners'
    existing knowledge to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their
    own research. Data Carpentry workshops take researchers through the entire
    data life cycle.</p>

    community to use software and data in their own work, as well as be
    advocates for and train others in efficient, effective and reproducible data
    and software practices.</p>
